# Experience map

## Motivation

Try to identify instances where you felt demotivated to work on your tasks.
Analyze the cause of your demotivation and come up with a strategy to get motivated.
Use this Experience Map to write a short account of what caused your motivation drop,
what were you trying to achieve at the time, and how did you try to get motivated to continue.
It could be useful to reflect on if you felt demotivated for similar reasons before.
Bear in mind that there are no right or wrong answers!
Feel encouraged to share your subjective experience in your own voice!
You may find it useful for your work to read/watch any of the
background materials recommended in the course curriculum,
especially the list of possible causes for demotivation.
