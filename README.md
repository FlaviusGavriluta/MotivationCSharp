# Motivation

## Story

You decided to start working towards your dream of becoming an IT professional.
Your goal seems monumental and vague. Where should you start? Should teach yourself or
find a programming school? Which technologies should you learn? What other skills do you need?
In this situation, you can get overwhelmed quickly by the vast number of decisions that you need to make upfront.
It is natural to get demotivated in a situation like this.

You mastered the basics of your chosen programming language,
the small exercises bore you, you feel your growth slowing down,
yet at the same time the more involved projects seem cryptic and you
don't know how to even start working on them; every step forward feels like a misstep.

Let's say that you already started your journey, and you are months into it,
churning out complex projects. You begin to tire of coding all the time and haven't
hung out with friends for weeks now to concentrate on your studies.
You begin to feel that you can't focus on one thing for an extended period and
your bed seems more and more inviting by the second.

These are common problems that can evaporate our motivation and cause us to abandon our goals.
They can occur at any time and put us in a slump if we are not cautious.
We can resolve them by asking some honest questions about ourselves when we are feeling demotivated,
and develop strategies to overcome these issues in order keep our motivation flow steady.
We will learn about the different causes of demotivation and how to address them to
get ourselves motivated and back on track again.

## What are you going to learn?

- Recognize and categorize demotivating factors.
- Get motivated by managing these factors.

## Tasks

1. Attend the `Motivation` workshop in the course of your studies (Look for the next event in the student calendar.)
    - The student attended the Motivation workshop

2. Observe yourself during the two weeks following the workshop and try to identify instances where you felt demotivated to work on your tasks. Analyze the cause of your demotivation and come up with a strategy to get motivated. Use the attached Experience Map to write a short account of what caused your motivation drop, what were you trying to achieve at the time, and how did you try to get motivated to continue. Bear in mind that there are no right or wrong answers. Feel encouraged to share your subjective experience in your own voice.
    - A complete Experience Map in the `experience-map.md` is filled in.

## General requirements

None

## Hints

- Keep an open mind and be honest to yourself when you reflect on why you feel demotivated.
- Try to write down or talk to someone about the possible causes of your demotivation, this helps you form a coherent picture.
- Structure the steps you want to take towards your goal to help track your progress.
- Break down your task to smaller ones and complete them. This can give you motivation boosts to keep you going.
- Motivation is not a constant; it ebbs and flows, that is why it is important to create habits that help you achieve your goals.
